# rpi_daily_display

This is just a little thing I have setup on a table. It displays some information from home assisant on the LCD screen and I have the led
matrix doing a little dance for fun.

I also have the PIR sensor sending an event to HomeAssiant which trigger all my lights to come on after a certain time of day and then turns them off after a minute

It uses the following components

A Raspbery PI 3 (but any RPI or similar computer could work)

[Parallax Serial LCD Screen](https://www.parallax.com/product/parallax-2-x-16-serial-lcd-with-piezo-speaker-backlit/)

A plain old led

A PIR sensor
